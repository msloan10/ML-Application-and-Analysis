# ML-Application-and-Analysis

**Description:**
This project uses the Stanford Cars Dataset (https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) to build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify car images by make, model, and year. The CNN model that is developed will be embedded into a desktop application that will give all of the information about the car stated above, and the trade in value according to the KBB API.  

**Phase 1**
- EDA
- Data cleaning\ manipulation

**Phase 2**
- Modeling (CNN)
- Hyper-parameter tuning
- Testing

**Phase 3**
- Deployment into a python application 
- The application takes a image of a car as the input and returns the make, model, year, and trade-in value.
